# Milestone 5: Reopen Command Tests

The reopen command tests were analyzed and found to be already compatible with the new position behavior.

## Key Findings

1. **No changes needed** - All 7 reopen tests pass without modification
2. **Tests use CreateStoreWithSpecs** - This creates done todos with regular positions (not 0)
3. **Position-agnostic testing** - Tests verify status changes without asserting specific positions
4. **Isolation testing** - Tests focus on reopen behavior in isolation from position management

## Architectural Note

In real usage, done items have position 0 and cannot be found via position paths. This is a limitation of the position path system, but doesn't affect these unit tests.

## Test Results

All tests pass:
